#           Appeatite
#### A waiter-less fine dining experience



## Project Description


Appeatite will contain a digital version of restaurants’ menus displayed using a mobile application. It will be an interactive process in which both users and restaurant employees will participate. When a customer enters a restaurant that is using our service, they will have to scan a QR code placed on their dining table, using the application’s camera. The users will then be prompted to a screen which will display the generic details of that restaurant’s menu. The menu will consist of information such as meal names, ingredients, calorie counts, images, proportions and prices. The interface of the application will be simple and abstract, in the sense that information will be shown on user’s request. Then, upon selecting the desired items, the restaurant will be notified that an order has been placed and they will be able to detect from which table, as all QR codes will specify to a different table location. 

The restaurant will require one employee to manage this using one simple desktop computer. We will create a web application for the restaurant to manage their orders. Furthermore, they will be given an interface allowing them to add relevant information about their food items, and create their initial menu. We have considered the possibility that some old fashioned users may wish to simply speak to someone to order, and therefore we will implement an option to call a worker to come and assist them with their order, answer any questions or take the order manually. 

Since many customers have trouble deciding on their order, we will have a simple review system where previous people who have ate at the restaurant can leave a rating and small review on particular dishes. 

We will also use machine learning techniques or simple algorithms to determine an expected wait time for each dish. Thus, customers can order food accordingly to the amount of time they have and can have some knowledge on how long they will be expected to wait.

The benefits for the customer include:
o	Conveniences of ordering food
o	Fast service
o	Access to an up-to-date menu
o	Ability to learn more about what they are ordering
o	Ability to remove specified ingredients from a dish
o	Call for assistance at the touch of a button

The benefits for the restaurant include:
o	Minimal hardware required
o	Have a up to date online menu at all times
o	No need to hire extra employees; save costs
o	Attract new customers with this new system
